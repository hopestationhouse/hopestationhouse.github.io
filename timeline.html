														as the Hope CNR station was the connector to the rest of the province and sites of internment that those
														of Japanese ancestry were unjustly sent to. 2,644 of these citizens were loaded in the back of trucks at
														the station house to make the 19 km journey to Tashme. <br /><strong>Source:</strong> Nikkei National
